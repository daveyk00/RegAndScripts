Enable LSA Runas PPL audit as per:

Check:
Determine whether LSA starts in protected mode when Windows starts, take the following steps:
    Open Event Viewer.
    Expand Windows Logs > System.
    Look for the following WinInit event: 12: LSASS.exe was started as a protected process with level: 4.




When LSA protection is enabled, the system generates event logs that identify all the plug-ins and drivers that fail to load under LSA.
After you opt in to added LSA protection, you can use the event log to identify LSA plug-ins and drivers that fail to load in LSA protection mode.
Check for the following events in Event Viewer by expanding Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > CodeIntegrity > Operational:
    Event 3033 occurs when a code integrity check determines that a process, usually LSASS.exe,
        attempts to load a driver that doesn't meet the Microsoft signing level requirements.
    Event 3063 occurs when a code integrity check determines that a process, usually LSASS.exe,
        attempts to load a driver that doesn't meet the security requirements for shared sections.
Shared sections typically result when programming techniques allow instance data to interact with other
processes that use the same security context. Shared sections can create security vulnerabilities.
